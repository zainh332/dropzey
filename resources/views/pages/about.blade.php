                                        platform designed to fuel the growth of decentralized autonomous organizations
                                        (DAOs) on the Stellar blockchain. We are driven by the vision of empowering any
                                        Stellar-based project to leap into the future of decentralized
                                        governance.</span></span></span></p>

                                        style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">At LumosDAO, we provide an
                                        easy-to-use interface for DAO creators. Our users can seamlessly log in through
                                        their Stellar wallets, like Freighter, Rabet, or Xbull, and start creating their own
                                        DAOs. We leverage the power of the Stellar TOML files to fetch key information about
                                        your project, streamlining the DAO creation process.</span></span></span></p>

                                        style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">To create a DAO, creators need to
                                        pay a nominal one-time fee of 10,000 LUMOS, our native token. The LUMOS token, built
                                        on the Stellar network, is set to drive the LumosDAO ecosystem
                                        forward.</span></span></span></p>

                                        democratic governance. Our platform enables DAO members to join any DAO, create
                                        proposals, vote, and participate in the decision-making process. All votes are
                                        immutably recorded on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring trust and transparency in our
                                        decentralized community.</span></span></span></p>

                                        a suite of features designed to foster a vibrant LumosDAO community. A dedicated
                                        forum for open discussion, a safe crowdfunding mechanism, an Airdrops and Bounty
                                        panel, and the choice between a light and dark theme are all on the

                                        LUMOS tokens, LumosDAO is ready to reshape the world of DAOs on the Stellar network.
